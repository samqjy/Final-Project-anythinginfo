			<h3>Introduction</h3>
			<p>In this project, we are working with a dataset that utilizes the amount of carbon dioxide produced per capita from 1960 to 2014 through emission levels. This dataset was collected by the Global Carbon Project; an international science community that aims to increase research on climate changes and spread further awareness on the global carbon cycle. The data was accessed through the Global Carbon Projectâ€™s affiliated website called Global Carbon Atlas, a platform used by the community to visualize different datasets illustrating carbon fluxes which resulted from human activities and natural processes.</p>

			<br>

			<h3>Target Audience</h3>
			<p>Due to the nature of our dataset, our project is geared towards climate change activists who are conscious about global warming. Additionally, we would also like to spread awareness on this issue with everyone else, as it will ultimately affect all of our lives as well.</p>

			<br>

			<h3>Visualizations</h3>
			<p>The dataset is split into three different types of visualization. The first utilizes a chloropleth map to display carbon emissions produced in million metric tons per kilometer in each country. The map can also be filtered by years, as inputed by the user using a slider widget. The second is a chart visualization that allows users to pick from a list of countries and have the chart return a visualization based on that country's carbon emissions from 1960 to 2014. The third visualization is a statistical summary of the dataset. In this part of the project, we calculated the top ten countries with temperature changes as a result of carbon emissions over time, as well as key information on how temperature change correlates with carbon emissions per country.</p>

			<h3>Limitations</h3>
			<p>One of the main limitation we encountered during this project was the ability to answer one of the main questions posed in our project proposal. In the project proposal, we hoped to compare the differences in carbon emission levels between continents using the information included in our dataset. However, due to the bulk of the dataset, it was difficult for us to manually assign continents to every single country, thus preventing us from accurately providing an answer to the proposed question.</p>
