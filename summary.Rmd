## Global Carbon Emission Since 1960


### Summary

The global average temperature change is **`r get_avg(tem_change)`** celsius. There are **`r get_num_above_avg(tem_change)`** countries above the global average temperature change. Since 1960, **all** countries have a positive change in carbon emission and **all** the countries have a rise in the temperature change as well.

####Here is a table about the top ten temperature change countries.

`r get_top_ten(tem_change)`
<br><br>





#### Here is a map of global temperature change.

`r get_graph(tem_change)`

#### Conclusion
From the table and the map we can see that the top ten countries are either near **the Arctic Circle**, or near **Middle East** and Mediterranean.
