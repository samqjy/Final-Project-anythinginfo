## Global Carbon Emission Since 1960


### Summary

The global average temperature change is **`r average_tem_change`** celsius. There are **`r num_above_avg`** countries above the global average temperature change. Since 1960, **all** countries have a positive change in carbon emission and **all** the countries have a rise in the temperature change as well.

####Here is a table about the top ten temperature change countries.

`r kable(top_ten_emission)`

#### Here is a map of global temperature change.

`r temp_graph`

#### Conclusion
From the table and the map we can see that the top ten countries are either near **the Arctic Circle**, or near **Middle East** and Mediterranean.
